  A passionate young mind who has curious personality and really values freedom.
  <br><br>
  Eager to explore anything I found interesting. Putting forward rationality and compassion in every aspect of my life. A solutive person who always trying to find the middle ground all problems. Everything and everyone can become my teacher.
  <br><br>
  I consider myself as a present-oriented person, which means I strive to make the "now" enjoyable for me and for the people and things around me. Because of my rational and compassionate approach on life, I grow to really take equality seriously. That is the reason why I envision myself to become a person who can help people who struggle with inequality, to get the "equal" the deserve.
  <br><br>
  Currently in my second year learning Statistics at Universitas Gadjah Mada and I am curious what the future will bring!
